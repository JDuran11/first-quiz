# Security question

Knowing that the OWASP Top 10 was updated in 2021, adding three new categories, and considering the necessary information for the company, we can take the following measures for each point.

## Access Control Loss

- Ensure that employee privileges are limited to strictly necessary functions.
- Conduct access audits and continuous monitoring to identify and correct potential access control violations.

## Cryptographic Failures

- Use secure communication protocols like HTTPS to protect data transfer between the application and the server.
- Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database, such as passwords and customer information.

## Injection

- Use parameterized queries and stored procedures to prevent SQL injection in the MySQL database.
- Implement input filtering and validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks.

## Insecure Design

- Implement secure design patterns and development best practices to ensure security from the design phase.

## Incorrect Security Configuration

- Maintain regular security configuration updates to adhere to best practices and address the latest known threats.

## Vulnerable Components

- Establish a vulnerability management process to regularly monitor and update the components and dependencies used in the application.

## Identification and Authentication Failures

- Use secure authentication methods, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA), to protect access to the application and the database.

## Software and Data Integrity Failures

- Implement security testing and code analysis to identify and correct potential vulnerabilities in the software and ensure data integrity.

## Logging and Monitoring Failures

- Configure detailed logs and establish an event monitoring system to detect and respond to potential security incidents in a timely manner.
- Conduct regular reviews of logs and events to identify patterns of malicious or anomalous activity.

## Server-Side Request Forgery

- Implement protective measures against server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks using anti-CSRF tokens and request validation techniques.
